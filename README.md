# AlphaFast

Ultra-high-throughput inference with [AlphaFold 3](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3). Replaces Jackhmmer with [MMseqs2-GPU](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) for **over 68x** speedup in homology search and **over 22x** speedup in end-to-end inference on a single H200 GPU.

AlphaFast has **multi-GPU** capabilities capable of reaching throughput of **8s per input** on 4 H200 GPUs, **4.5s per input** on 8 H200 GPUs, and even higher throughput on larger systems, scaling approximately linearly with number of devices.

For minimal setup or those without significant computational resources, see our [Modal Setup](#modal-setup) section for serverless inference at a cost of **$0.035** and time of **28s** per input.

> **Disclaimer**: AlphaFast requires AlphaFold 3 model weights, which are subject to
> [Google DeepMind's Terms of Use](WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).
> You must apply for and receive weights directly from Google. This is not an officially supported Google product.

> **Note**: RNA MSA search uses nhmmer (CPU-based). DNA chains use empty MSA, matching AlphaFold 3's native behavior.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Acquire Model Weights

Request access to AlphaFold 3 model parameters via
[this form](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6) from Google. Approval typically takes 2-5
business days. You will receive a file of compressed weights named `af3.bin.zst`.

### Step 2: Choose Your Compute Environment

| Environment | Requirements | Jump to |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Local Server | Docker, Sudo Access | [Docker Setup](#docker-setup) |
| HPC Cluster | Singularity, SLURM | [HPC Setup](#hpc-setup) |
| Serverless | Modal Billing Account | [Modal Setup](#modal-setup) |

## Docker Setup

### Step 3: Download and Convert Databases

Downloads and converts protein sequence databases to MMseqs2 GPU format.

> **Important:** Point `path/to/databases` to a fast data drive (NVMe recommended). You will need a minimum of **1.1 TB** free disk space for the default setup (250 GB download + 540 GB protein MMseqs2 padded + 234 GB mmCIF + 89 GB RNA FASTA). The optional MMseqs2 nucleotide databases for faster RNA search add ~865 GB (use `--rna_mmseqs_db_dir`). For pre-built databases from HuggingFace, use `--from-prebuilt` to skip conversion.
>
> **Prerequisite:** The `mmseqs` binary (GPU version), `wget`, `zstd`, and `tar` must be installed and in your `PATH` before running this script. See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for MMseqs2 installation instructions.

```bash
./scripts/setup_databases.sh /path/to/databases
```

### Step 4: Pull Container

> **Optional:** To build the container from source instead, see [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

```bash
docker pull romerolabduke/alphafast:latest
```

### Step 5: Place Weights
>
> **Note:** There are several ways to move the weights to your server such as direct download from the link provided by the DeepMind team, SSH transfer via utilities like [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) or [scp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp).

```bash
cp /path/to/downloaded/af3.bin.zst /path/to/weights/
```

### Step 6: Create Input

Create a directory of input `.json` files. See [docs/input_format.md](docs/input_format.md) for the full format reference. Minimal example:

```json
{
  "name": "2PV7",
  "sequences": [
    {
      "protein": {
        "id": ["A", "B"],
        "sequence": "GMRESYANENQFGFKTINSDIHKIVIVGGYGKLGG..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "modelSeeds": [1,2,3],
  "dialect": "alphafold3",
  "version": 3
}
```

**RNA-Protein Complex:**

```json
{
  "name": "rna_protein",
  "sequences": [
    {
      "protein": {
        "id": ["A"],
        "sequence": "MVLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTTKTYFPHFDLSH"
      }
    },
    {
      "rna": {
        "id": ["B"],
        "sequence": "GGGGACUGCGUUCGCGCUUUCCCC"
      }
    }
  ],
  "modelSeeds": [1],
  "dialect": "alphafold3",
  "version": 3
}
```

### Step 7: Run Inference

> **Note:** Performance gains from AlphaFast scale from: input batch size, GPU compute capability/VRAM, and number of GPUs.

**Single GPU:**

```bash
./scripts/run_alphafast.sh \
    --input_dir /path/to/inputs \
    --output_dir /path/to/outputs \
    --db_dir /path/to/databases \
    --weights_dir /path/to/weights
```

**Multi-GPU:**

```bash
./scripts/run_alphafast.sh \
    --input_dir /path/to/inputs \
    --output_dir /path/to/outputs \
    --db_dir /path/to/databases \
    --weights_dir /path/to/weights \
    --gpu_devices 0,1,2,3
```

### How Multi-GPU Mode Works

When multiple devices are specified via `--gpu_devices`, AlphaFast runs a **phase-separated parallel pipeline**:

1. **Partition** — Inputs are distributed round-robin across GPUs. Identical protein sequences are deduplicated within each partition.
2. **Phase 1: Parallel MSA** — All N GPUs run batched MMseqs2-GPU search simultaneously.
3. **Phase 2: Parallel Fold** — AlphaFast waits until MSAs are complete then data files are re-distributed and all N GPUs run inference simultaneously.

At large batch sizes, every GPU is 100% utilized in each phase, achieving near-linear scaling.

## HPC Setup

### Step 3: Install Databases
>
> **Important:** Point `path/to/databases` to a high speed volume with fast network transfer. You will need a minimum of **1.1 TB** free disk space on this partition (250 GB download + 540 GB MMseqs2 padded + 234 GB mmCIF + 89 GB RNA FASTA). Use `--from-prebuilt` to download pre-built databases from HuggingFace. AlphaFast will spend roughly ~1 hour to copy the databases to a local NVMe volume (often called `/scratch` on HPC systems). If this is not available, then make sure the databases are on the fastest I/O partition possible.
> **Note:** You may need to edit the SLURM directives to match your university's specific HPC formatting.

```bash
# Submit as SLURM job (CPU node, no GPU needed)
sbatch scripts/setup_databases.sbatch /path/to/databases

# Or run directly in an interactive session:
./scripts/setup_databases.sh /path/to/databases
```

### Step 4: Pull Container
>
> **Important:** Most university HPC systems contain apptainer or singularity rather than Docker for permission management. Depending on your HPC setup, your home directory may very small; therefore, you should ensure your apptainer or singularity cache directory is set to an appropriately sized and speed volume. For more information, see [docs/hpc.md](docs/hpc.md) for specific guidance.

```bash
singularity pull alphafast.sif docker://romerolabduke/alphafast:latest
```

### Step 5: Place Weights
>
> **Note:** There are several ways to move the weights to your university HPC system such as direct download from the link provided by the DeepMind team, SSH transfer via utilities like [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) or [scp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp). Most university systems will have a data transfer node with services like [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) that may be useful.

```bash
rsync -avP /local/path/af3.bin.zst user@hpc:/path/to/weights/
```

### Step 6: Create Input

Create a directory of input `.json` files. See [docs/input_format.md](docs/input_format.md) for the full format reference. Minimal example:

```json
{
  "name": "2PV7",
  "sequences": [
    {
      "protein": {
        "id": ["A", "B"],
        "sequence": "GMRESYANENQFGFKTINSDIHKIVIVGGYGKLGG..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "modelSeeds": [1,2,3],
  "dialect": "alphafold3",
  "version": 1
}
```

### Step 7: Run
>
> **Note:** Performance gains from AlphaFast scale from: input batch size, GPU compute capability/VRAM, and number of GPUs. On HPC systems specifically, AlphaFast will attempt to transfer almost all code, the container, databases to the local `/scratch` directory of a compute node. This transfer can take up to 1-2 hours depending on network speed; therefore, AlphaFast is optimally used for very large input batch sizes.
> Furthermore, if you note significant slowdowns, you should ensure the cache directory for package managers like uv and other system packages is not set to a slow filesystem on your cluster setup. If all else fails, our [Modal Setup](#modal-setup) section should be used instead for your needs.

```bash
./scripts/run_alphafast.sh \
    --input_dir /path/to/inputs \
    --output_dir /path/to/outputs \
    --db_dir /path/to/databases \
    --weights_dir /path/to/weights \
    --container /path/to/alphafast.sif \
    --gpu_devices 0,1,2,3
```
